{$productname} 'embedded' installer for Flash device or HDD.

- Create 1 partition for OS image
- Uses a RAM disk to limit read/write access to the device

WARNING: There will be some limitations:
1. This will erase ALL partitions and data on the destination disk
2. You can't use your destination disk for sharing data

Installing on USB key is the preferred way:
It saves you an IDE or SCSI channel for more hard drives.
