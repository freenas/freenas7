FreeNAS 0.8 (Golden Path):
--------------------------

WARNING: This release will not be the 0.8 release
It's an experimental testing

Majors changes:
- Upgrade to FreeBSD 8.0-Release:
   - Enable the new AHCI drivers for SATA (/dev/ad0 became /dev/ada0)
        (TODO: Need to use glabel for mounting disk,hide drivers changes)
   - add atapicam that permit to use a CD Burner software
- Add gmultipath, disk mutlipath control utility(FR #2835904)

Minors changes.
- Update php to 5.2.14.
- Do not ask for network card OPT if only one network card detected
- Update URL of the website (http://freenas.org)
- Improve the display of IP addresses in console mode
- Update iSCSI initiator to 2.2.4.

Permanent restrictions:
- It is not possible to format a SoftRAID disk with MSDOS FAT16/32.
- It is not possible to encrypt a disk partition, only complete disks are supported.
- It is not possible to get seperate CPU stats per processor on SMP machines because
  FreeBSD does not support that feature.
- Enable 'polling' on interfaces used by a LAGG interface will make it inoperable.
- It is not possible to mount EXT2 disks with an inode size of 256 bytes. You
  have to format it with 128 bytes on Linux to use them on FreeBSD.

Known bugs:
- If DHCP for IPv4 is used, the IPv6 statically configured DNS server will be
  overriden by the IPv4 DNS server.
- Downgrading to 0.69 via WebGUI fails because of broken pipe error.
- FreeBSD's ext2fs module, as of release 7.1, cannot mount ext2 file systems
  with 256-byte large inodes, only 128 byte sized.  Unfortunately, 256 byte is
  the default size with many recent Linux distributions.

NEED TESTING:
- IPv6: auto mode
- All services using IPv6 address (NFS, FTP, etc...)
- Netatalk VFS Samba module (automatically enabled when Netatalk starts) crashes
  samba when accessing to share
- Need to write an online-test procedure

Help needed:
- Need help for adding LDAP authentication feature:
  Main services can be easily authenticated using PAM-LDAP, but is harder for Samba.

FreeNAS 0.69 (Kwisatz Haderach):
--------------------------------

Majors changes:
- Add TFTP service. It is accessible via 'Services|TFTP' in the WebGUI.
- Add Samba patch CVE-2008-4314.
- Upgrade nano to 2.0.9.
- Upgrade PHP to 5.2.8.
- Add WOL support for misc NIC's. Thanks to Tobias Reber for porting WOL patch
  to FreeBSD 6.4.
- Upgrade nfe driver. Thanks to Tobias Reber for backporting FreeBSD 7.0
  driver and adding WOL support.
- Finally fixed Samba lock file problem (they are located in /var/db/samba now).
  You can increase the memory filesystem size for /var for LiveCD and 'embedded'
  installations by modifying the rc.conf variable named 'varsize'. This is
  necessary if you are running out of file space for *.tdb files (this normally
  happens on heavy Samba share usage with many users). The default size is 32MB.
- Replace FTP server pure-ftpd 1.0.21 with proftpd 1.3.2rc3. Please note that
  there can be set additional options via rc.conf variables which are not
  displayed in the service WebGUI. Please have a look into /etc/rc.d/proftpd
  script for a detailed list of options.
- Add TCP Wrappers. All applications linked against libwrap support this
  feature, for example services like FTP, TFTP, SSH, NFS... The rules can be
  configured via WebGUI 'Network|Hosts'.
- Upgrade ATAidle to 2.4.
- Upgrade transmission to 1.42.
- Upgrade rsync to 3.0.5.
- Upgrade cdialog to 1.1.20080316.

  swap space.

- Add nfsstat for NFS diagnostics (FR 2093184).
- Do not display links for files in Quixplorer file view.
- Add knobs to the fusefs rc.d script (NTFS support) to safely wait until all
  data has been written on shutdown. To enable this feature you have to set
  the rc.conf variables 'fusefs_safe=YES' and 'fusefs_safe_evil=YES' in
  'System|Advanced|rc.conf'.
- Display CPU temperature and frequency in 'Status|System' page (FR 2480272).
  The frequency levels are displayed as tooltips. Please note that these values
  are not displayed if FreeBSD is not able to get these hardware informations
  via sysctl.
- Update translation files. Thanks to all translators contributing to FreeNAS.

Bug fixes:
- The 'default gateway' entered during the console setup is not set without
  doing a reboot (BR 2406068).

  http://de.php.net/manual/en/function.filesize.php for detailed description.
- iSCSI-Target target configuration should only accept one extent or device
  as storage (BR 2454804).
- If 'Hard disk standby time' is set for a drive, the execution of ataidle
  is delayed to prevent drives to spin up again during the boot process
  because ataidle immediately spins down the drives on execution. The delay
  value (default is 60 seconds) can be modified via 'ataidle_delay' rc.conf
  variable (BR 2471158).
- Get SNMP module 'netgraph' working. Fixed by adding missing kernel modules.
- Static IPv6 ifconfig is set correct now in rc.conf.
- QuiXplorer incorrectly copies premissions (BR 2491739).
