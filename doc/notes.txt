Todo list for FreeNAS 0.7:
-Send the core dump of clog (to be compiled with debug?) to Jeff Wheelhouse <jdw@wheelhouse.org
=> There are no core dump generated by clog, only incredible huge log file-Try to not use gpt on geom devices.... Need to check when gpt (disk more than 2TB) is really usefull
- Review the disk/Storage/share part:
  "Disk": One page for managing physical drive (including hardware RAID)
  "Volume/Storage" (name to define): One page for define all geom drive and formatting, with automating mounting (mount should be transparent to the user)
  "Share": One page for create share (directory on mount) add assing user/group permission qutas, and protocol available for this share (table with enable/edit option)

- Update/Adapt rc.d scripts (there are new scripts in FreeBSD)
- Update build/kernel-config/FREENAS-amd64
- Implement new sensor framework: coretemp ?
- Geli: propose to use crypto key (without password), stored on USB key. This mean that geli drive will be mounted automatically if the usb is present during startup.
  But what happens if the NAS is on the attic or in the basement? What if we have a high secure environment, don't think somebody wants to
	leave the keys on the USB alone to simply let them steal?
 => Here is an example of use: At the end of the days you power off the BIG NAS server (containing all your confidential data), and put the small USB key in the safe for the night/week-end.
- Prevent to use duplicate disk name....

General notes:

- Encrypted user passwords in config.xml:
	It is not possible to use encrypted passwords in config.xml because
	'smbpasswd' needs plain-text passwords to create its own user database.
	For 'pw' this is not a problem because it accepts md5 encrypted passwords using parameter '-H'.

- The 'vfs_readahead' Samba plugin is not usable on FreeBSD because the kernel
  does not support a required POSIX function (posix_fadvice). SO it is buildable
  on FreeBSD, but it will produce a syslog entry that the plugin is not
  supported on this platform:

	readahead_sendfile: no readahead on this platform

	See ../samba3/work/samba-3.0.26a/source/modules/vfs_readahead.c for more
	details.
