################ History Change logs ##############

FreeNAS 0.7:
------------

Majors changes:
- Upgrade to FreeBSD 7.0.

Minors changes:

Bug fixes:

Permanent restrictions:
- It is not possible to format a SoftRAID disk with MSDOS FAT16/32.
- It is not possible to encrypt a disk partition, only complete disks are supported.

Known bugs:
- If DHCP for IPv4 is used, the IPv6 statically configured DNS server will be overriden by the IPv4 DNS server.

NEED TESTING:
- IPv6: auto mode
- All services using IPv6 address (NFS, FTP, etc...)
- Netatalk VFS Samba module (automatically enabled when Netatalk starts) crashes samba when accesing to share
- Need to write an online-test procedure

Help needed:
- Need help for adding LDAP authentication feature:
Main services can be easily authenticated using PAM-LDAP, but is harder for Samba.

  - Add pcn (AMD Am79C97x PCI 10/100 (with precedence over 'lnc')) network driver.

  You have to reconfigure the UPnP service to get working properly. XBox 360 is not supported, sorry.

  VMWare users which require this setting have to install in 'full' mode and edit loader.conf by hand.
