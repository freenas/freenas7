- Encrypted user passwords in config.xml:
	It is not possible to use encrypted passwords in config.xml because
	'smbpasswd' needs plain passwords to create its own user database.
	For 'pw' this is no problem because it accepts md5 encrypted passwords
	using parameter '-H'.

- The 'vfs_readahead' Samba plugin is not useable on FreeBSD because the kernel
  does not support a required posix function (posix_fadvice). SO it is buildable
  on FreeBSD, but it will produce an syslog entry that the plugin is not
  supported on this platform:

	readahead_sendfile: no readahead on this platform

	See ../samba3/work/samba-3.0.26a/source/modules/vfs_readahead.c for more
	details.
