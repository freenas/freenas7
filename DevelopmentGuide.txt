This is short guide of the development rules used in FreeNAS:

Main rule is ---> Keep It Small And Simple <--- 

This means FreeNAS main target is to be a NAS that can be used by
novice users. It shouldn't be a WebGUI for a full FreeBSD server. So
services and tools that do not have something to do with a NAS will
not be included into FreeNAS (e.g. geek features).

To ensure code quality and a seemless intergration of new features
ONLY the project leader/maintainer/developers will introduce new code in
the main development trees.
Developers have to create subprojects in /experimental to store their features.
After discussion and code review the project leader/maintainer will include
the code into the main code trees (e.g. /trunk or /branches).
To create a subproject in /experimental please recreate the directory
structure of the target development tree and add only the new or modified
files. DO NOT create a branch from any tree to keep SVN repository size low.
It is also possible to send patches.

To add new WebGUI elements use the UI control creation functions in
www/guiconfig.inc (e.g. html_inputbox to create a input box). This should
be done to make changes in the WebGUI look easy as possible.

Global settings:
- Use real tabs in source files. The tab width is 2.
- Files must be in UTF-8 and Unix format.
