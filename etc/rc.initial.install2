{$productname} has been installed on $installharddrive.
You can now remove the CD-ROM and reboot the PC.

To use the DATA partition:
1. Add the disk $harddrive on the Disks: Management page
2. Add the mount point on the Disks: Mount point page
(disk: $harddrive, partition 2, Filesystem: UFS + Softupdates)
DO NOT format the $harddrive drive! The data partition has been formatted for you as part of the installation!

Press ENTER to continue.
