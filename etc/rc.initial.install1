{$productname} "Embedded" installer for flash device or hard-drive.

WARNING: There will be some limitations:
1. This will erase ALL your partitions and data on the destination disk
2. You can't use your destination disk for sharing data
3. You can't install {$productname} if it's already installed on this disk
   (use upgrade from WebGUI)

Install on USB key is the prefered way:
It saves you an IDE or SCSI channel for more hard drives.

Here is the list of detected CDROM(s):

	}

		$harddrive = chop(fgets($fp));
		if ($harddrive === "") {
			exit(0);
		}

	echo <<<EOD

{$productname} has been installed on $harddrive.
You can now remove the CD-ROM and reboot the PC.

Press ENTER to continue.
