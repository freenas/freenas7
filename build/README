- /freenas/rootfs: Minimum FreeBSD root filesystem and FreeNAS script/WebGUI

2. How to generate an FreeNAS ISO or IMG  file

Edit the scripts '/freenas/svn/build/make.sh' and modify the directory
variables with your local ones.

Check that you have installed the following ports:
- subversion
- bash

Start /freenas/svn/build/make.sh

Burn the freenas.iso file created.

=================================
3. Building FreeNAS with the latest sources

(normally possible with make.sh)

Here is how to build a FreeNAS from the latest source file:

- Use the root user account on your FreeBSD system

3.1 Update your freenas scripts/WebGUI code with SVN:
(this create the svn directory)

cd /usr/local/freenas

svn co https://freenas.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/freenas/trunk svn

You should now have this directories now:
/usr/local/freenas
/usr/local/freenas/svn

3.2 Update your ports collection:

Using portsnap the first time:
portsnap fetch extract

To update the ports collection:
portsnap fetch update

3.3 Use the building script:

svn/build/make.sh

Execute all menus in '20 - Build FreeNAS from scratch advanced menu' to build your FreeNAS
from scretch. After that use one of the following menus:

10 - Create FreeNAS IMG file (rawrite to CF/USB/DD)
11 - Create FreeNAS ISO file (need cdrtools installed)
12 - Create FreeNAS ISO file without IMG image (need cdrtools installed)
