================================
1. Files and directories listing
- /freenas/bootloader : Contains FreeBSD boot loader files
- /freenas/rootfs: Minimum FreeBSD root filesystem and FreeNAS script/WebGUI
- /freenas/svn: Contains the whole up-to-date (working) release and scripts

===============================================
2. Preparing your FreeBSD for compiling FreeNAS
The FreeNAS build scripts are stupid scripts: They copy the binary files of your FreeBSD host.
This means that your FreeBSD used for compiling FreeNAS need to be compiled/re-installed with this /etc/make.conf:
- NO_SHARED=no
- Debug symbol disabled (comment the line WITH_DEBUG=yes if you have it)
- Remove all customization for CPU (comment the line CPUTYPE?=native if you have it)
Check the make.conf include in the source

Note about NO_SHARED: It seems that since FreeBSD 5.0 many executables binaries in /bin and /sbin are build using dynamic linking (this KNOBS is a m0n0wall heritage, don't know if it's still important to use it).

=============================================
3. How to generate an FreeNAS ISO or IMG file

Edit the script '/freenas/svn/build/make.sh' and adapt the directory
variables with your local ones.

Check that you have installed the following ports:
- subversion
- bash
- cdrtools
- portupgrade

Additional you might install the following ports, otherwise they are build
from sources:
- perl
- ruby
- m4
- bison

Start /freenas/svn/build/make.sh

Burn the freenas.iso file created.

=================================
3. Building FreeNAS from the latest sources

(normally possible with make.sh)

Here is how to build FreeNAS from the latest sources:

- Use the root user account on your FreeBSD system

3.1 Update your FreeNAS scripts/WebGUI code with SVN:
(this creates the svn directory)

cd /usr/local/freenas

svn co https://freenas.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/freenas/trunk svn

You should now have these directories:
/usr/local/freenas
/usr/local/freenas/svn

3.2 Update your ports collection:

Using portsnap the first time:
portsnap fetch extract

To update the ports collection next time:
portsnap fetch update

3.3 Use the building script:

svn/build/make.sh

Execute all menus in '20 - Build FreeNAS from scratch advanced menu' to build your FreeNAS from scratch. After that use one of the following menus:

10 - Create 'Embedded' (IMG) file (rawrite to CF/USB/DD)
11 - Create 'LiveCD' (ISO) file
12 - Create 'LiveCD' (ISO) file without 'Embedded' file
13 - Create 'Full' (TGZ) update file

=================================
4. Building kernel

Before building the kernel it is recommended to delete the directory /usr/src completely.
Next, run the build scripts and update the kernel sources via cvsup + freebsd-update.
Continue building using the 'Build kernel' menu in the build script.
