- Encrypted user passwords in config.xml:
	It is not possible to use encrypted passwords in config.xml because
	'smbpasswd' needs plain-text passwords to create its own user database.
	For 'pw' this is not a problem because it accepts md5 encrypted passwords using parameter '-H'.

- The 'vfs_readahead' Samba plugin is not usable on FreeBSD because the kernel
  does not support a required POSIX function (posix_fadvice). SO it is buildable
  on FreeBSD, but it will produce a syslog entry that the plugin is not
  supported on this platform:

	readahead_sendfile: no readahead on this platform

	See ../samba3/work/samba-3.0.26a/source/modules/vfs_readahead.c for more
	details.
