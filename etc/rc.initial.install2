FreeNAS has been installed on $installharddrive.
You can now remove the CD-ROM and reboot the PC.

For using the DATA partition:
1. Add the disk $harddrive on the Disks:Management page
2. Add the mount point on the disks:Mount point page
(disk: $harddrive, partition 2, Filesystem: UFS + Softupdates)
DO NOT format the $harddrive drive !

Press ENTER to continue.
